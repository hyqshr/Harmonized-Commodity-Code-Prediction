Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HS-Code) codes provide a systematic structure for the classification and taxation of products. Customs experts assign HS codes to tens of thousands of products every day. This manual process of assigning codes is a time-consuming, tiresome, and error-prone task. 

we crawled numerous US Imports data from the US Imports website  https://usimports.info/, we are using multiple models including **YAKE, RAKE, KeyBERT, ResNet** for HS-code prediction.
